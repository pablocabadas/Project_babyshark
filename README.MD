Sometimes we appreciate live from the top of the table without any worry.

Hi, and be welcome to Bite & Cash, where you can die for a bite ;).
Bite & Cash it's a life insurance where you can surf without any issue, you can enjoy of the activity, and if you die for any chance, your family it's going to cry... of happiness.
Because our life insurance can assure your life for at least €100.000 (the amount of bites is not included in the promotion).

To know the rentability of our business we have done an investigation based on data that have been recollected since the creation of the seas, Global Shark Attacks data frame on Kaggle platform.

Once we have the data frame, we based the investigation on the countries where we cash the bite, those countries are USA, Australia, España, Costa Rica, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa.

After we set our data on those countries, we clean the data of the Nan values (we are talking about values equal to "0", not the Indian and Pakistan bread), and we did it deleting those rows without any data on the country, region, age, year, activity and fatality section of the data frame.

After that, we filter the data just with those bites or attacks that happen on top of the board. Bite & Cash, is a company that believes the sport in on top of the table, not swimming on it or doing some paddle or even fallen of the table, a surf table is for surf.

With that clear, we can proceed and see a data frame structured with Country, Region, Year, Age, Activity (remember, Surfing, nothing less) and Fatality. 

After that we set 3 different tables to see the Bitetality in 3 different ranges of age, 0 to 17 and young, 18 to 60 as adult and more than 60 as senior, this is to see where we have to be more strict o more exclusive in our service at the moment when we sell the service.

After we set the tables, and we run the numbers based on the fatality of the attacks based in the ages and the different countries, we can conclude:
    - No matter your age, the probabilities of getting bite are high, but the people don't die that easily.
    - The countries with the most amount of bites are USA (obviously the center of the word) and Australia, so we can base our activities there. We can always scare people to get more clients.
    - And last but not least, the business is extremely profitable, this is because we only ensure and pay if people die, but the statistics show people just die in a few attacks during the years, so we can just say two things about this:
        - You will get a bite, that's a fact.
        - Show me your money MTF (My Tough Friend).

Thanks for your attention and remember,
Every bite leaves your family closer to the bush of money.
